 1. Quantization, Pruning, and KVCache Compression for Efficient Large Language Models
    - Relevant: To optimize large language models (LLMs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) for reduced memory and computational costs while maintaining performance, this research direction integrates quantization, pruning, and KVCache compression into a unified framework.
 2. Voice, Language, and Visual Multimodal Large Models
    - Relevant: This research introduces a novel multimodal large model that integrates text, language, and vision modalities. The goal is to advance the performance and generalization capabilities of the model by establishing a new approach for training and fusing these modalities effectively, rather than focusing on incremental optimizations.
In suggesting papers to your friend, remember that he enjoys papers on large language model (llm) compression, Multimodal Large Models.
