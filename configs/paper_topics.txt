 1. New advancements in quantization techniques for large language models
    - Relevant: Papers that introduce novel methods for quantizing large language models, especially those focusing on reducing model size or computational requirements without sacrificing performance. This can include methods such as low-bit quantization, quantization-aware training, and optimizations that maintain or improve the model's efficiency and performance. Research that combines quantization with techniques like rotation matrices is particularly relevant.
 2. Observing the Characteristics of large language model Activation Values
    - Relevant: Papers that identify specific characteristics of activation values in large language models like LLaMA at different positions like attention value, and use these findings to explore the impact of activation value distributions on inference results. Such research aims at improving or enhancing the performance of large language models based on these observations.
 3. Improving the Efficiency of Large Language Model KVCaches
    - Relevant: Papers that enhance the efficiency of KVCaches in large language models, such as those focusing on compressing or pruning KVCaches to reduce memory and computational load during inference.
