 1. Quantization, Pruning, and KVCache Compression for Efficient Large Language Models
    - Relevant: To optimize large language models (LLMs) for reduced memory and computational costs while maintaining performance, this research direction integrates quantization, pruning, and KVCache compression into a unified framework.
 2. Voice, Language, and Visual Multimodal Large Models
    - Relevant: This research aims to train a model that effectively integrates multiple modalities, such as text, language, and vision, to enhance the model's performance and generalization ability. The approach helps optimize model training and improves the synergy between different modalities during the fusion process.
