 1. Quantization, Pruning, and KVCache Compression for Efficient Large Language Models
    - Relevant: To optimize large language models (LLMs) for reduced memory and computational costs while maintaining performance, this research direction integrates quantization, pruning, and KVCache compression into a unified framework.
 2. Token-Level Expert Selection and Activation Calibration for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Models
    Relevant: To enhance the efficiency and performance of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this research direction investigates token-level expert selection strategies, sparse activation patterns, and calibration set optimization to improve routing decisions while minimizing computational overhead.
    Key Focus Areas: Dynamic Token-to-Expert Assignment: Analyzing how input tokens are routed to experts, including top-k gating, noisy top-k, and learnable routing policies.
    Activation Sparsity & Load Balancing: Studying expert utilization and methods (e.g., auxiliary loss, expert choice routing) to prevent underused or overloaded experts.
    Calibration for Robust Routing: Optimizing validation set selection and fine-tuning strategies to adapt routing behavior for downstream tasks.
    Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-offs: Evaluating how different expert selection mechanisms impact model size, inference speed, and task performance.
